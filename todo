todo
1. timing test for every vector member functions
2. add reverse iterator to vector + test into all.cpp
3. add ft_stack.hpp + tests
4. separate folders between vector and stack (+ map in near futur)
5. test lexicographical_compare
6. test traits
7. templated tests (vector, stack, map)

maybe
- ikos
- configure script
- scripts folder
- since we test timing with chrono instead of time, we don't need one executable by function.
--> why not put every test into one file ? (done at, back, begin, capacity, clear)
- remove prefix ft_std des fichiers ? (les placer dans des dossiers ft/ et std/ suffisent)
