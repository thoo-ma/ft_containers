todo
1. add ft_map.hpp + tests
2. test timing stack
3. test timing vector iterators
4. test lexicographical_compare
5. test type_traits
6. test _everyting_ with -Wconversion and valgrind
7. test size_max for vector !!!
8. is_constructible and co. (cf. type_traits) for pair conversions
--> need by -Wconversion
9. iterators operators: member or non-member functions ?
10. rb_tree: use _comp to compare keys (otherwise remove it)
11. handle error when _any_ allocate() fails (gotta catch bad_alloc)
12. debug iso_stardard script
13. base_iterator: iterator traits typedefs + comparison operators
14. output_iterator.hpp to .cpp
________

maybe
- explicit qualifer upon constructors
- ft::equal (upon all ft datatypes: map, vector, tree, pair, etc.)
- ikos --> utile pour les uninitialized values (valgrind output_stack)
- configure script
- `make all` re-mkdir output folders but not timing ones...
- rename src/ into test/
- keep our iterator_traits but forget abour our iterator struct
--> this way, we can use stl algorithms act upon our containers
- east const instead of west const
- make sure that const_iterator = begin() calls the begin() method that returns
const_iterator
--> and not begin() returning iterator then construct const_iterator from it
- add default destructors to be coplien compliant
- say some about when we need or don't need typename after typedef
--> ex: iterators typedefs vs containers typedefs
________

readme
- explain why constructors are explicit
- explain why east const instead of west const
--> the only consistent way to write const (got to read from right-to-left)
- explain the difference between const and non-const begin() and end()
- explain why we choose this implementation for const_iterator
--> explain why the templated solution is better in term of debugging
(i.e. clangd doesnt warn with my solution when 'it = const_it', whereas
it would do with the template solution.)
- say some about the vague subject and why some tests here may be overkill
- explain why map.end() dereferencing segfault: no sentinel node
- make note that insert with hint is just a regular insert
________

iterators
- vector --> random access iterator
- map    --> bidirectional iterator
- base_iterator (iterator traits typedefs + operateurs comparaison)
________

template <bool>
struct ft_static_assert;

template <>
struct ft_static_assert<true>{};
