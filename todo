todo
1. timing test for every vector member functions
2. add reverse iterator to vector + test into all.cpp
3. add ft_stack.hpp + tests
4. separate folders between vector and stack (+ map in near futur)
5. test lexicographical_compare
6. test traits
7. templated tests (vector, stack, map)

maybe
- ikos
- configure script
- scripts folder
 -> test_timing
 -> test_output
 -> test_lexicographical_compare
 -> test_type_traits
 -> test_compiler_version
- since we test timing with chrono instead of time, we don't need one executable by function.
 -> why not put every test into one file ? (done at, back, begin, capacity, clear)
- remove prefix ft_ std_ des fichiers ? (les placer dans des dossiers ft/ et std/ suffisent)
- `make all` re-mkdir output folders but not timing ones...

Makefile
- -I when compiling from obj to bin ?
