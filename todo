todo
1. timing test for every vector member functions
2. Makefile relink (ex: make timing)
3. add reverse iterator to vector + test into all.cpp
4. add ft_stack.hpp + tests
5. separate folders between vector and stack (+ map in near futur)
6. test lexicographical_compare
7. test traits
8. templated tests (vector, stack, map)

maybe
- ikos
- configure script
- scripts folder
