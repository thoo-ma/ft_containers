todo
1. add reverse iterator to vector + test into all.cpp
2. add ft_stack.hpp + tests
3. separate folders between vector and stack (+ map in near futur)
4. test lexicographical_compare
5. test traits
6. templated tests (vector, stack, map)
________

vector_timing > 20
- clear
- push_back
- resize
- insert
________

maybe
- ikos
- configure script
- scripts folder
 -> test_timing
 -> test_output
 -> test_lexicographical_compare
 -> test_type_traits
 -> test_compiler_version
- since we test timing with chrono instead of time, we don't need one executable by function.
 -> why not put every test into one file ? (done at, back, begin, capacity, clear)
- remove prefix ft_ std_ des fichiers ? (les placer dans des dossiers ft/ et std/ suffisent)
- `make all` re-mkdir output folders but not timing ones...
________

Makefile
- -I when compiling from obj to bin ?
